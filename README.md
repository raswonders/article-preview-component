## My process

This one was intersting because, I wasn't sure how to approach two visual styles of popover at first. They render div block on mobile but abosolutely positioned bubble on desktop. I started with one for the mobile, and then expanded the component for desktop. It worked, but I have feeling there is probably a better way to do it. It felt like I'm rethinking a whole component again for desktop.
